Welcome to the SDET interview programming exercise.

The primary goal of this task is to judge your ability to
1. Understand the purpose of and rationale behind unfamiliar code
2. Identify and make improvements based on your personal sensibilities
3. Identify and resolve bugs in unfamiliar code

The specific task is to analyse the ProductFilter::identifyActiveKeys method for code quality issues, and places for
improvements around the algorithm and the readability of the method.

The only things that should not be changed are the method signature, and the structure of POJOs included.

There is also an included test class that should pass 100% of the time when the code is working properly.
